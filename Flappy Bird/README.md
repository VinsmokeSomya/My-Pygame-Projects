# Flappy-Bird

Take a flight down memory lane with this Flappy Bird game implemented in Python! Recreate the iconic gameplay of guiding a pixelated bird through a maze of pipes, adding your unique touch to the classic experience. This open-source project is not just about the game but is also an opportunity to dive into Python game development. Clone the repository, run the code, and let the flapping fun begin. Customize and expand upon the game to make it your own.
